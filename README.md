# LIS2DE12_Accelerometer
Allows you to easily communicate with the STI Tri-axial accelerometer model LIS2DE12 using the I2C protocol for use with Arduinos or other micro-controllers.

Feel free to use the however you want and edit and edit/distribute as needed. Credit would be appreciated, but not mandatory.

More in the README to come, along with a guide to getting started using the LIS2DE12 (or similar) accelerometers with an arduino.
